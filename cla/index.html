                    <p>ZydiaLabs SAS ("ZydiaLabs") appreciates your willingness to grant permission to use your software code checked directly into a source control system made available by GitHub Inc ("Contributions") in conjunction with the ZydiaLabs projects hosted there. By clicking ["AGREE"] you ("you" or "You") hereby grant to ZydiaLabs and to recipients of software distributed through ZydiaLabs projects a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, make, have made, offer to sell, sell, import, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works as part of ZydiaLabs projects. </p>

                    <br>

                    <h3>3. Grant of Rights</h3>

                    <h4>3.1 Copyright License</h4>

                    <p>(a) You retain ownership of the Copyright in Your Contribution and have the same rights to use or license the Contribution which You would have had without entering into the Agreement.</p>

                    <p>(b) To the maximum extent permitted by the relevant law, You grant to Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable license under the Copyright covering the Contribution, with the right to sublicense such rights through multiple tiers of sublicensees, to reproduce, modify, display, perform and distribute the Contribution as part of the Material; provided that this license is conditioned upon compliance with Section 3.3.</p>

                    <h4>3.2 Patent License</h4>

                    <p>For patent claims including, without limitation, method, process, and apparatus claims which You or Your Affiliates own, control or have the right to grant, now or in the future, You grant to Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license, with the right to sublicense these rights to multiple tiers of sublicensees, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution and the Contribution in combination with the Material (and portions of such combination). This license is granted only to the extent that the exercise of the licensed rights infringes such patent claims; and provided that this license is conditioned upon compliance with Section 3.3.</p>

                    <h4>3.3 Outbound License</h4>

                    <p>Based on the grant of rights in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, if We include Your Contribution in a Material, We may license the Contribution under any license, including copyleft, permissive, commercial, or proprietary licenses. As a condition on the exercise of this right, We agree to also license the Contribution under the terms of the license or licenses which We are using for the Material on the Submission Date.</p>

                    <h4>3.4 Moral Rights.</h4>

                    <p>If moral rights apply to the Contribution, to the maximum extent permitted by law, You waive and agree not to assert such moral rights against Us or our successors in interest, or any of our licensees, either direct or indirect.</p>

                    <h4>3.5 Our Rights.</h4>

                    <p>You acknowledge that We are not obligated to use Your Contribution as part of the Material and may decide to include any Contribution We consider appropriate.</p>

                    <h4>3.6 Reservation of Rights.</h4>

                    <p>Any rights not expressly licensed under this section are expressly reserved by You.</p>

                    <br>

                    <h3>4. Agreement</h3>

                    <p>Just as we are respectful of your rights in the Contributions, we want to insure that we will not need to seek additional permission to use the Contributions from any third party.</p>

                    <p>You confirm that:</p>

                    <p>(a) You have the legal authority to enter into this Agreement.</p>

                    <p>(b) You or Your Affiliates own the Copyright and patent claims covering the Contribution which are required to grant the rights under Section 3.</p>

                    <p>(c) The grant of rights under Section 3 does not violate any grant of rights which You or Your Affiliates have made to third parties.</p>

                    <p>(d) You have followed the instructions in www.canonical.com/contributors, if You do not own the Copyright in the entire work of authorship Submitted.</p>

                    <p>(e) You represent and warrant that you are the sole owner of the Contributions and/or have sufficient rights in your Contribution to grant all rights you grant hereunder.</p>

                    <p>(f) You represent that the Contributions are your original works of authorship, that you created the Contributions and did not copy them from another source, and no other person claims, or has the right to claim, any right in any invention or patent related to the Contributions.</p>

                    <p>(g) You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer has rights to intellectual property that you create, you represent that you have received permission to make the Contributions on behalf of that employer, or that your employer has waived such rights for the Contributions.</p>

                    <p>(h) Finally, it means that you have not entered into any agreements that would prevent you from granting the rights provided in this Agreement. You understand that the decision to include the Contribution in any product or source repository is entirely that of Adobe and this agreement does not guarantee that the Contributions will be included in any product, technology or services.</p>

                    <br>

                    <h3>5. Disclaimer</h3>

                    <p>IMPORTANT: Contributor provides the Contribution “AS IS” and makes NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, either express or implied. In particular, Contributor makes NO WARRANTY OF THE CONTRIBUTION’S QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORINESS, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Contributor disclaims and Project accepts DISCLAIMER OF ANY INDEMNITY under this agreement or by operation of law.</p>

                    <br>

                    <h3>6. Miscellaneous Terms</h3>

                    <p>6.1 This agreement constitutes the entire understanding between you and ZydiaLabs with respect to the subject matter hereof, and there are no inducements, representations, warranties, or understandings that do not appear expressly in this agreement.</p>

                    <p>6.3 This agreement may be modified only by express written agreement of ZydiaLabs.</p>

                    <p>6.4 This agreement shall be governed by the laws of Colombia applicable to contracts deemed to be made within Colombia, without regard to choice of law or conflict of law provisions. Furthermore, the parties agree that any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this agreement shall be instituted in a federal or state court located in Colombia, and the parties irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of such court and waive any objection to the venue or the inconvenience of such forum.</p>
